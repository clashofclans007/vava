- store state, and restore state on open. write config to $HOME/lib/duit/torrent/config, write torrents to $HOME/lib/duit/torrent/torrents
- show rates and eta per download, in a gridlist UI widget (that doesn't exist yet)
- allow setting per file whether you want to download it, and show progress per file
- when showing readable sizes, pick one and stick to it.  eg 2000k/3m looks weird
- show where files are saved, let user change location?
- show client info somewhere
	- peer id
- show current overal status:
	- peers, dht status, total download/upload rate, total download/upload size
- deal with .torrent files too
